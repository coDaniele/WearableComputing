## Johns Hopkins Coursera course [Data Science]
### Part 3: Getting and Cleaning Data, Course Project

### Objective: To collect data, prepare clean and tidy dataset for analysis 

This is a course assignment for the Coursera Data Science, part 3 (Getting and Cleaning Data), given by Johns Hopkins. The premise is to collect and clean up data using R programming, starting with a raw dataset.  
  
The dataset consists of experimental measurements generated by the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S II Smartphone worn on the waist of 30 volunteers who perform 6 different activities, with the goal of recognizing the activity based on data (see Note).  
  
The dataset is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unpacked into the working directory inside the folder UCI HAR Dataset.  
  
The R script run_analysis.R opens the datafiles in the set to extract the data from txt file format, combining several files into one merged dataset. Specifically, a Training and a Test dataset are merged and annotated using columns denonting study subject and experimental activity. Collumn headers are extracted from a feature file and used to select the relevant portion of the data. 

Once the datasets are merged and annotated, the measurements are averaged per subject and experimental activity.
